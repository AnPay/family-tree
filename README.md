[Refer this image for clear understanding] (https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/files/2012/03/IMG_1553.jpg).

The family tree data structure is implemented using all functonalities in main program.

###In my family tree user can:
* Add new person
* Find relationship b/w two persons
* Search

* Display

From the family tree data structure one can create any number of family trees and merge them also!
