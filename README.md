The family tree data structure is implemented using all functonalities in main program.

In my family tree user can:\n
1. Add new person\n
2. Find relationship b/w two persons\n
3. Search\n
4. Destroy\n
5. Display\n

From the family tree data structure one can create any number of family trees and merge them also!
